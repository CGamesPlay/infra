# Joplin Server

Joplin Server is a [pre-release sync server](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-server-pre-release-is-now-available/13605) for Joplin. Joplin natively support WebDAV sync engines like Seafile, and even S3, but according to the developer this native server is able to sync much faster, particularly on mobile clients.

## Installation

After submitting the job to Nomad, open the page and log in using the default username (`admin@localhost`) and password (`admin`). Change these to something else, then configure Joplin to sync.
