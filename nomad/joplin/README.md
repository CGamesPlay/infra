# Joplin Server

Joplin Server is the native sync solution for [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org). Joplin natively support WebDAV sync engines like Seafile, and even S3, but according to the developer this native server is able to sync much faster, particularly on mobile clients.

## Installation

After submitting the job to Nomad, open the page and log in using the default username (`admin@localhost`) and password (`admin`). Change these to something else, then configure Joplin to sync.
